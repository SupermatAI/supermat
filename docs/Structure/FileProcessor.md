# File Processing System

The `FileProcessor` module forms the foundation of Supermat's document handling capabilities, converting various document formats into our structured `ParsedDocument` model while preserving their hierarchical organization.

## Architecture Components

### Handler

The `Handler` orchestrates document processing through two key components:

1. **Converters**: A collection of utilities that transform various file formats into a standardized format for parsing. For example:
   - Converting `.docx` to `.pdf`
   - Converting `.pptx` to `.pdf`
   - Future support planned for additional formats

2. **Parser**: Processes the standardized format to generate the `ParsedDocument` model.

This modular approach allows for:

- Format flexibility
- Easy integration of new document types
- Consistent parsing behavior across different input formats

### Parser

The Parser component performs the critical task of transforming documents into our structured `ParsedDocument` model while:

- Maintaining complete document fidelity (lossless conversion)
- Preserving hierarchical relationships (sections, paragraphs, sentences)
- Converting unstructured text into a structured Pydantic model

#### Current Implementation

We currently support PDF parsing through two powerful backends:

1. [PyMuPDF](https://pymupdf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/): An open-source PDF processing library
2. [Adobe PDF Services API](https://developer.adobe.com/document-services/docs/overview/pdf-services-api/): Professional-grade PDF processing

#### Document Model

Our `ParsedDocument` model is designed to capture the complete structure of a document while making it processable for AI pipelines. For detailed information about the model structure and capabilities, refer to our [model documentation](reference/core/models/parsed_document.md).

### Future Enhancements

We plan to expand the File Processing System with:

- Support for additional document formats
- Enhanced structure detection algorithms
- Improved metadata extraction
- Advanced formatting preservation
- Custom parsers for specialized document types
